        <p> There are <em>many</em> things that people enjoy, 
        this can range from movies, video games and even simple recipes. </p>
        <p>So I thought I'd set up a <em>list, of <strength> lists!</strength></em>
        About a few things I like. :) Please, enjoy.</p>

        <ul>
            <p> First up we have some of my favourite foods and ingredients that
                inevitably I will need to go buy soon. 
            </p>
            <li>Chicken thighs</li>
            <li>Dill</li>
            <li>Bell peppers, sweet peppers and hot peppers (Habanero included)</li>
            <li>Ground lamb</li>
            <li>Tomatoes!</li>
            <li>Garlic!</li>
            <li>Ginger!</li>
            <li>MSG!</li>
            <p> And yeah, that would about sum it up for foods at least
                , though I could go on forever.
