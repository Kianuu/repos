        <p> There are <em>many</em> things that people enjoy, 
        this can range from movies, video games and even simple recipes. </p>
        <p>So I thought I'd set up a <em>list, of <strength> lists!</strength></em>
        About a few things I like. :) Please, enjoy.</p>

        <ul>
            <p> First up we have some of my favourite foods and ingredients that
                inevitably I will need to go buy soon. 
            </p>
            <li>Chicken thighs</li>
            <li>Dill</li>
            <li>Bell peppers, sweet peppers and hot peppers (Habanero included)</li>
            <li>Ground lamb</li>
            <li>Tomatoes!</li>
            <li>Garlic!</li>
            <li>Ginger!</li>
            <li>MSG!</li>
            <p> And yeah, that would about sum it up for foods at least
                , though I could go on forever.
            </p>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <p><em>Next up</em>, is a list of things I need to do today, which at this time is ~ 6:00 pm
            on a Tuesday. So let's get <strong>"Roooight into it!"</strong></p>
            <li>Finish this Assignment</li>
            <li>Not forget to pick up my girlfriend from work at 8:00 pm</li>
            <li>Message a family friend about a work thing</li>
            <li>Get dinner or make dinner</li>
            <li>Maybe do laundry</li>
            <li>Do some more Odin Project</li>
            <li>Go to sleep before 12:00 am</li>
            <p><strong>So yeah!</strong> if you're wondering <em>"What the hell is up with all these italics and boldings??</em>
            I do apologize, I'm just practicing the strong and em tags which make the bold and italic words you see.</p>
        </ol>
        
        <ul>
            <p>So, in this list you'll be getting a taste of where I want to go and honestly,
                I wouldn't mind <strong>moving to a n y of these</strong> places because they tend to be forested. 
                Thus, my dream place to visit is anywhere that's relatively cozy and full of life and nature. 
            </p>
            <li>Yukon</li>
            <li>A Redwood Forest</li>
            <li>Any Old Growth Forest</li>
            <li>The Northwest Territories</li>
            <li>Malaysia (with my girlfriend)</li>
            <li>Singapore (^^ + for the food)</li>

            <p>That's just a small list of places I'd like to visit if I <em>really had to pick</em>
             though I'm sure there's plenty more places to go.</p>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <p>Now here's a simple top five list, might remind you of <em><strong>WatchMojo</strong></em>, 
            but this is my 5 favourite video games so far.</p>
            <li>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</li>
            <li>Elden Ring</li>
            <li>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</li>
            <li><strong>LISA</strong>: The Painful</li>
            <li>Super Mario Sunshine</li>
            <p>You may have noticed that the top two are dedicated to FromSoft games, that's because
                I adore Hidetaka Miyzakai and his work. They just... <strong> <em>Resonate with me.</strong></em> and even 
                more than that my dream is to one day become a director of FromSoft like he did, make a few games of my own
                and then inspire someone else to rise up and create the fantastic quality of games he makes too. This, this whole webpage 
                for me is just the start of my journey towards that dream too!
            </p>
        </ol>
        <p>Anyways, that's just a few lists of things that I enjoy, from food to games to whaever else. :) Thanks for 
            stopping by!
